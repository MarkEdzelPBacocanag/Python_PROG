    "-Correctness: The implementation correctly models a base Vehicle class with shared attributes (color, mileage, fuel_liters ) and shared methods (drive, refuel ). The Truck class overrides drive() to reflect lower fuel efficiency, and the logic ensures fuel never drops below zero. The mileage updates accurately based on actual drivable distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Complexity: The code maintains low complexity. Each method performs a single, clear task.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Robustness: The classes handle edge cases like insufficient fuel gracefully. However, the code could be improved by adding input validation (e.g., preventing negative values for km, liters, or km_per_liter) and optionally enforcing maximum fuel tank capacity. These additions would make the system more resilient in real-world scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Readability: The code is clean and well-structured. Class and method names are intuitive, and print statements provide clear feedback during simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Faithfullness: The design stays true to object-oriented principles. Inheritance is used effectively to avoid duplication, and method overriding in Truck reflects domain-specific behavior. The test script demonstrates usage clearly and reinforces the benefits of abstraction and specialization.\n"
